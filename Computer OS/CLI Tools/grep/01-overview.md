# Overview

```bash
$ grep [options] [regexp] [filename]
```

**Grep** is an acronym for "Global Regular-Expression Print". It is a combination of four different tools:

1. basic regular expressions
2. extended regular expressions
3. fixed strings
4. Perl-style regular expressions

## Uses

1. Can be used to search a given file or files on a system.
2. Can be used to send output from another command that `grep` will then search for the desired content.
3. Can be used to search for a particular string throughout all files in an entire filesystem.
4. Can be used to examine command output to look for occurrences of a string.

## Ways to Search

1. searching for fixed strings
2. searching for patterns of text
